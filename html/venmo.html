        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Venmo is an app that allows users to pay and request money
            from any other user. At its core, Venmo provides a way to pay
            off debts when cash is too cumbersome. I am an avid user
            myself, and have realized that Venmo seems to be plagued by
            issues. I gave myself two weeks to try and understand and
            diagnose these issues.</h3>

        <h1>EMPATHIZE</h1>
        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <h3>I began the process by conducting a few in-depth interviews with
            my friends and family who I knew were prominent users of the app.
            <br><br>
            I wanted to be able to be thorough in order to catch most of the
            faults that exist in the app. Besides understanding who these users
            were, I also wanted to have them tell me any problems they have
            experienced already with the app (which were plentiful) and then
            conducting a usability test.
            <br><br>
            Almost all of my interviewees expressed some issue, or seemed to
            struggle with certain UI in the app.

        <h1>DEFINE</h1>
        <h2>Pain Points</h2>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <h3>Venmo’s app is plagued with UI issues. Much of the design seems
            obsolete or makes it harder for users to do what they intend. Lack of certain
            functionalities and presence of too many extraneous ones are leading
            to an unenjoyable UX. </h3>

        <h1>IDEATE</h1>
        <h2>Prioritization</h2>
        <h3>I used the MoSCoW Method in order to start prioritizing my ideas in
            terms of how feasible they were and how impactful they would be.
            My focus will be on the ones in dark blue.</h3>

        <img class="moscow" src="../images/venmo/moscow.png">

        <h2>Task Flow</h2>
        <h3>We created two task-flows. One is based off of a card-sorting activity we
            conducted with users in our research, and the other for the whole app.</h3>
        <img class="card-flow" src="../images/venmo/card-sort.png">
        <img class="task-flow" src="../images/venmo/Task Flow.png">

        <h2>Paper Sketches</h2>
        <h3>I proceeded to start sketching out the basic UI according to my flows,
            personas, and needs that I created.</h3>

        <div class="sketch-wrapper">

        </div>

        <h1>PROTOTYPE & TESTING</h1>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <h3>I began sketching out potential solutions to the pain points and prioritized
            goals I had set.</h3>

        <img class="wires" src="../images/venmo/wires.png">

        <h3>I did a couple preliminary evaluations for my sketches and utilized the
            feedback I received to refine my sketches to be converted into wires.</h3>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <h3>After creating a few Hi-Fi prototypes, I began evaluating them via Nielsen’s
            Usability Heuristics. Once I was satisfied, I ran A/B tests on specific features
            I was unsure about.<br></h3>

        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>

        </video>
    </div>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <h3>I returned to the intial group of interviewees and had them conduct a few
            tasks that highlighted the pain points I targeted while I observed. I followed up with a debrief to collect
            more data. </h3>

        <img class="validation" src="../images/venmo/validation.png">

        <h3>Based off of this feedback I believe I was successful in alleviating many of the 
            critical issues venmo currently has, however, there is always room for improvement.
            In future steps I may try to focus more on how to enhance the search functionality 
            further through more user testing and ideation.
