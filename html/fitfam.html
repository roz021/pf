            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>This fall I undertook a quarter long project for a design course at UCSD where I worked on an app with
                fellow<br />
                classmates, Edwin Fu and Mayu Wilson. The objective was to create something that enhanced one or more
                of<br />
                the following aspects: health, recreation, or family. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="container" id="designprocess">
        <h1 id="h1">Design Process</h1>
        <p>The prompt given to us was extremely broad to give us as much creative freedom as possible. We first needed
            to choose one activity which we<br />
            believed may have room for enhancement that would be tangible through an app. In our case, we chose working
            out. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="needfinding">
        <h2>Needfinding</h2>
        <p>Once we knew what our activity was, we began making observations. Me and my teammates each interviewed two
            individuals in order to<br />
            create personas for our target audience in hopes of better understanding who we were designing this app
            for. We chose to limit our target<br />
            demographic to just college students because our aim was for this app to first be adopted by UCSD, and
            later by other college campuses. </p>

        <p>We adopted the double-diamond process by first going as broad as possible. This meant interviewing a wide
            variety of students in order to</br>
            benefit the whole college community, then once we found a tangible problem, we tightened our observations
            to look for design opportunities.</br>
            Our interviews consisted of both participant observations as well as diary studies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="ourresults">
        <h2>Our Results</h2>
        <p>We found that the biggest problem for college students is finding someone to work out with. There were also
            four obvious categories of students<br />
            who worked out: those who did so actively (daily), moderately (between three-five days a week), rarely
            (less than three times a week), and finally<br />
            those who did not work out at all. In all cases, we found striking similarities.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Social accountability is a huge factor in committing to working out</li>
            <li>Besides getting you to go to the gym, having a buddy who can spot you is vital in getting the most
                progress </li>
            <li>It is surprisingly hard to meet new people, especially when many are already situated within cliques</li>
            <li>For students who bus to school, sometimes the trip to the gym is a waste because it is so packed, and
                can get chaotic</li>
            <li>Students find it hard to coordinate schedules with their friends because of how variable everyone’s
                lives are</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>How can we make finding new people to exercise with easier for college students?</strong></p>
        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p>From the data we collected, we already had a good idea about why students were experiencing this problem, so
            next we decided to formulate a<br />
            point of view that we could use as a guideline for the rest of the process. </p>
        <p><strong>Exercise & healthcare is easiest and most enjoyable when there is a sense of community</strong></p>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>By designing with the four personas in mind, we concluded that the biggest problem is finding new people to
            work out with (which includes issues such as scheduling conflicts,<br />
            and difficulty in meeting new people on a campus that isn’t socially focused) while also noting how people
            who are not gym rats may not know how to properly exercise or <br />
            may not even know where to begin. Thus, our app creates a community by using the UCSD student database to
            create accounts attached to their school email. As long as a student<br />
            chooses to use this campus resource, they will instantly be connected with all other students on campus.
            Users are able to sift through students which they can filter by gender,<br />
            age and skill level. Of course, if this app is a fitness app there must be documentation that helps
            students learn new exercises and create routines for themselves. </p>

        <p>Once we had a working prototype coded through HTML/CSS/JS, we began running some user tests.</p>
        <p>As a result we found issues with our information scent. The user flow was choppy, and our testers were seen
            to use the back button a lot<br />
            among other things. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="../images/FF/initialtests.pdf">You
                may view our full testing notes as well as the planned changes we wanted to incorporate before our next
                iteration.</a></p>
        <p>To ensure that the breakdowns and pain points we noted were being resolved, we then ran A/B tests with our
            original design and redesign <br/>(the focus being on the friends page).
            We hypothesized that our redesign (version B) would do much better, and this was confirmed <a target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" href="../images/FF/abtests.pdf">by our results.</a></p>

        <p>Since this was one of the first bigger projects that I’ve tackled, I learned a great deal about what it takes to create an app from the ground up. I had a lot of fun going through<br/>
                iterations and watching the app go from a mess, to something that I’m pretty proud of. Creating icons, the logo, and coming up with a brand image was all a new experience for me,
                but thanks to Mayu and Edwin, I wasn’t alone. I wanted to also thank my TA Kandarp for making the process a lot smoother overall.</p>
