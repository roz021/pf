        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>This past fall me and two other designers decided to come
            up with a solution to UCSD’s lack of social aptitude. We felt
            that there simply wasn’t enough ways for students to meet
            each other, especially on such a large campus. We gave
            ourselves 8 weeks to fully design an app that could tackle
            this issue.</h3>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <h1>EMPATHIZE</h1>
        <h2>Interviews & Shadowing</h2>
        <h3>We began interviewing our friends and peers about the lacking social
            quality found on this campus. From this we found that there just were
            not many ways students can meet each other. A weak Greek Life and
            non-existant sports culture were among several reasons for this.

            <br><br>
            Many students expressed how it’s also hard to strike up conversation
            with peers if there isn’t a common thread to connect them. <br><br>

            We noticed that almost all students mentioned that throughout the
            week they would go exercise at the school gym at least once, although
            they would typically go alone.
        </h3>

        <h1>DEFINE</h1>
        <h2>Pain Points</h2>
        <h3 class="italicize">It’s hard to meet new people because many are already situated in
            cliques, and are unwilling to mingle without some common thread.
            <br><br>
            There aren’t many opportunities to meet people such as football
            games, parties, or club socials.<br><br>

            A lot of students are busy with coursework or a job and can’t make it
            to the limited number of socials on campus.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <h3>What we needed was to create a way for students to
            easily interact with each other through some commonality to
            combat the awkwardness many students feel when trying to
            make friends.</h3>

        <h1>IDEATE</h1>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <h3>After diverging and converging past many ideas, we decided to use
            exercising as the gateway for people to meet each other since most
            students had time to workout a couple times a week.<br>

            We decided to create FitFam, a way for students to interact by
            exercising and achieving their fitness goals. </h3>

        <h2>Task Flow</h2>
        <h3>We came up with some storyboards to give us an idea of how and
            when users would use our app, then used that to create a task flow</h3>
        <img class="task-flow" src="../images/FF-final/task-flow.png">

        <h2>Lo-Fi Sketches & Wires</h2>
        <h3>Based off of the pain points and personas we sketched out some
            options to test. Our goal was creating an enjoyable user experience
            that welcomes all students. </h3>
        <img class="wires" src="../images/FF-final/lo-fi.png">

        <h1>PROTOTYPE & TESTING</h1>
        <h2>Mid-Fi Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Moving forward we converted our sketches into a workable prototype
            in Adobe XD. Below are a couple key features.</h3>

        <img class="mid-fi" src="../images/FF-final/mid-fi.png">

        <h2>Testing Iterations</h2>
        <h3>We ran a heuristic evaluation based off of Jakob Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics.
            Based off of our findings we tweaked the sections that user’s had the most
            issues with. <br>

            We then ran A/B Tests to confirm our redesign was an improvement. </h3>

        <div class="test-wrapper">
            <img class="A" src="../images/FF-final/test-a.png">
            <img class="B" src="../images/FF-final/test-b.png">
        </div>

        <h3>We repeated this process until we were satisfied with our results
            which can be seen below</h3>

        <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Our final design focused on integrating a beautiful design with ease of use.
            Users should easily be able to figure out how to use the app and start
            connecting with other students.</h3>

        <h2>Clickable Prototype</h2>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>This was an amazing project to undertake because I felt that it taught me a lot about
            what it takes to be a designer. This was one of the first few large projects I’ve ever done,
            so much of this was a new experience for me. I learned a lot about core design concepts,
            as well as strengthening my skills with software. I had a lot of fun watching this app go
            from just a couple sticky notes on a white board to what it is now. </h3>
